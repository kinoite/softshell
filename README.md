# softshell (sfsh)

A simple, customizable shell built with Rust, featuring Lua for flexible configuration and dynamic modules. `sfsh` (Soft Shell) aims to provide a fast, extensible, and personalized command-line experience.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Rust Core:** Built with Rust for performance, safety, and reliability.
* **Lua Configuration:** Personalize almost every aspect of your shell, from the prompt to custom commands and keybindings, using simple Lua scripts.
* **Modular Design:** Extend `sfsh`'s capabilities by writing and integrating custom Lua modules.
* **Command History:** Persistent history of your executed commands for easy recall.
* **Rich & Customizable Prompt:** Create highly informative and visually appealing prompts using ANSI colors and Unicode glyphs.

### üöÄ Installation

To install `softshell`, ensure you have [Rust and Cargo](https://rustup.rs/) installed, then run the following command:

```bash
cargo install softshell
```

This will install the sfsh executable to your Cargo bin directory (e.g., ~/.cargo/bin). Make sure this directory is in your system's PATH.
Note on Glyphs: For the full visual experience of advanced prompts (like the "Pinnacle of Prettiness" theme), it is highly recommended to use a Nerd Font in your terminal emulator.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
sfsh looks for its main configuration file (config.lua) in the following order:
 * $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sfsh/config.lua (e.g., ~/.config/sfsh/config.lua on Linux/macOS)
 * ~/.config/sfsh/config.lua (common fallback if XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set)
 * ~/.sfshrc.lua
 * ./config.lua (in the current directory where sfsh is launched from - useful for development)
A good starting point for your configuration is to create one of these files.

### üìÑ Sample Configuration (.sfshrc.lua)
You can find a simple example of a configuration file here (link to your GitHub repo's simple config).
This file defines:
 * modules_path: Where sfsh will look for custom Lua modules.
 * history_file: The path to your command history file.
 * get_prompt(): The function that generates your shell prompt.
 * Custom Lua functions and commands accessible from the shell.

### üì¶ Lua Modules
sfsh's extensibility comes from its Lua module system. You can write your own Lua files and place them in the directory specified by modules_path in your config.lua.
For example, the Softhostname module (used to fetch the hostname reliably) is a separate Lua file:
``softhostname.lua``
 
### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
Once softshell is installed, simply run sfsh from your terminal:
sfsh

You can then type commands, and if you have a mycommands table defined in your Lua config, you can call those functions directly (e.g., mycommands.hello()
